* Admin pages
* API integration with other internal systems
* API integration with external partners

## Code check-in workflow
* Refer to the "New Git Branching" tab in this [Git Branching Schemes for mvp](https://app.diagrams.net/#G1vP4RAuhbfI-KkcBldcjj5VYIIhv8yW5x#%7B%22pageId%22%3A%22zIOwODEauE28Zps54nt9%22%7D)

## Code organization

* `db/` for various SQL scripts.
* `examples/` for adhoc sample scripts.
* `src/juloserver/` for application server.
* `test` for integration tests.

Check out their respective README for details.

## Commit message

To make every commit message has information about the JIRA ticket, every commit message
must be prefixed with the ticket number. Luckily you can do this automatically by 
executing following commands

```shell
pip install pre-commit==2.20.0

pre-commit install -t prepare-commit-msg
```
Command above will activate `prepare-commit-msg` git hooks inside the directory `.git/hooks`.
Do not edit this file directly!

For example, with branch name `feature/XXX-123/mmdd_feature_in_short`, it will transform your commit message as follows:

- `awesome commit` to `[XXX-123] awesome commit`
- `XXX-123: awesome commit` to `[XXX-123] awesome commit`
- `XXX-123 awesome commit` to `[XXX-123] awesome commit`
- `[XXX-123] awesome commit` a correct format, will do nothing

If you're actively working inside `src/juloserver`, do not worry, it will automatically
install it for you. Just follow the steps inside [installation instruction](./src/juloserver/README.md).
